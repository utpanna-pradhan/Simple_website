                <h3>*Choose Your Development Specialization</h3>
                <p>Generally speaking, most developers fall into one of three categories:
                    front end, back end and full stack.</p>
                <h4>1·Front End Development</h4>
                <p>
                    If you work in front end development, you manage the user
                    experience for people who visit a website. Front end developers
                    are experts in CSS, HTML and JavaScript, and can create the
                    code that brings website design ideas to life. Your tools
                    define how users interact with a website; if you love the
                    creative, visual side of web development, a front end career
                    may be a great option for you.
                </p>
                <h4>2·Back End Development</h4>
                <p>Back end developers design, maintain and improve the technologies that keep sites running behind the scenes.
                    Back end
                    developers use languages such as Python, PHP, Ruby on Rails and Java to build applications, manage
                    server-side
                    technologies and interact with front end code for faster, more responsive website experiences.</p>
                <h4>3·Full Stack Development</h4>
        
                <p>
                    You don’t necessarily have to choose between front and back end programming. If you have a strong aptitude
                    and
                    interest
                    in both aspects of web development, you may pursue a career as a full stack developer. These professionals
                    are
                    knowledgeable about all aspects of the web development process, from conducting back end, server-side
                    programming to
                    managing front end user experience.
        
                    This path may also be appealing to new career changers who don’t want to limit themselves early on in the
                    educational
                    process. For that reason, many coding bootcamps provide an array of full stack skills to give you a strong
                    foundation in
                    most major areas of development.

        <h3>*Keep Learning and Coding</h3>
        <p>
            Web development is an incredibly dynamic field, with new technologies, preferred frameworks and standards
            continually
            evolving.
        
            Even after you become a web development professional, one of the best ways to ensure your continued success is to
            keep
            learning and coding, exploring newer technologies and building upon your skills. According to recent reporting from
            Stack Overflow, roughly 75 percent of polled professional developers say that they learn a new technology “at least
            every few months or once per year.”
            Open-source technologies can be a great way for web developers to build their portfolios, strengthen their coding
            chops
            and network with others in the field.
        
            For example, sites like GitHub allow people to contribute to large, open-source projects and collaborate with other
            programmers. Good contributions and commitment to these projects can help introduce your work to others in the
            industry
            and build an even more diverse and technically rich portfolio.
        
            Like the projects you produce, a coding career is dynamic, interactive and continually evolving to suit the times.
            By
            remaining active in the community and sharpening your skills, you ensure that your skills stay marketable and
            relevant
            to employers’ needs.
        
        </p>
        <h3>*Keep Your Skills Strong</h3>
        <p>Many tech industry jobs involve a technical interview or a coding test. Even after you graduate, keep practicing and
            building projects. Beyond creating a great portfolio, this practice will keep you in good shape when it’s time to
            take a
            technical interview or ace a coding test.
        
            The good news is that web developers and coders are in high demand. Many employers are looking for web professionals
            who
            have the skills they need to keep their sites running and develop new applications. By keeping these tips in mind,
            you
            will be well-placed for a quick, successful career shift.</p>
        <h3>*Develop a Great Resume and Portfolio</h3>
        <p>Writing a great resume can highlight your technical skills and specialties for prospective employers at a glance.
            Action-oriented resumes that highlight your achievements and direct employers to your portfolio can help you get
            attention from hiring managers and show off your technical skills.</p>
        <h3>*Work Your Network</h3>
        <p>Networking is crucial for success in the tech industry.
        
            When you attend an online coding bootcamp or college program, you’ll likely develop connections with many other
            industry
            professionals. When you join message boards, open-source development groups or even social clubs, you should let
            people
            know that you are in the market for a job. When people are impressed by your work, dedication and technical skills,
            they
            just might refer you to the perfect opening for the next step in your career.</p>
        <h3>*Coding Bootcamps</h3>
        <p>Online coding bootcamps can be excellent resources for people who value flexibility and want to upskill quickly. In a
            bootcamp, students focus more on web development skills that employers are looking for in comparison to a more
            theoretical approach that college curricula typically offer.
        
            Bootcamps focus on teaching foundational and intermediate web development skills. Many bootcamp curricula are
            tailored
            to a particular area of focus (i.e., front end, back end, full stack). That said, you can expect to leave a full
            stack
            web development bootcamp with job-ready coding knowledge and a well-stocked professional portfolio.
        
            Full stack bootcamps are full, structured programs that provide experienced instructors, individualized support and
            lively class environments. They are particularly attractive for their flexibility; aside from being significantly
            cheaper than four-year degrees, many provide part-time night scheduling options that can be completed in as little
            as
            three to six months.</p>
